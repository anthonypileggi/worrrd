## Create an Rmarkdown document

For crosswords and wordsearches, the clues and word lists are printed alongside the puzzle.  However, this can get a little messy for longer lists.  An alternative is to generate an Rmarkdown document.

```{r setup}
library(worrrd)

# Generate a wordsearch puzzle
words <- c("dog", "cat", "squirrel", "bird", "fish", "panda", "wolf")
x <- wordsearch(words, r = 10, c = 10)

```

### Puzzle
```{r}
plot(x)
```

### Word List
```{r}
cat(x$clues, sep = "\n")
```
